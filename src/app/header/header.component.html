        <!-- <p>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit”
            (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a
            paragraph.
            For instance, in some styles of writing,
            particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p>
